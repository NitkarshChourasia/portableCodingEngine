# portableCodingEngine
## What I imagine to make is:-
- A tablet should be there.
- Physical external keyboard should be attached to it.
- Full hardware should be dedicated for that programming based environment, which is :-
  - Vim
  - Linux Shell and Terminal Emulator/Environment.
  - The programming environment should be able to use full hardware resources for it.
- To make a dedicated __portableCodingEngine__ in short.

First step to reach there is by :-
- First have a in depth practical knowledge about termux.
